# This script is used as a wrapper for test execution (via CMake's
# `CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`) to ensure that each test process has a unique
# `TEST_TMPDIR`.
#
# Many OpenGrm tests use hardcoded filenames in the temporary directory. When
# running tests in parallel, these tests can collide and fail. This wrapper
# isolates each test process by giving it its own scratch space.

set -euo pipefail

# Create a unique temporary directory for this process.
export TEST_TMPDIR="$(mktemp -d)"

# Ensure the temporary directory is cleaned up on exit (success or failure).
trap 'rm -rf "${TEST_TMPDIR}"' EXIT

# Execute the test with all provided arguments.
